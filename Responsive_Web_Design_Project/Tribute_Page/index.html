            <h2>"My life goal is to help all people stay away from hunger."</h2>
            <p class="timeline-text">Born in Beijing in 1930, Yuan graduated from Southwest Agricultural College in
                1953.</p>
            <p class="timeline-text">Shortly after a serious nationwide famine in the 1960s, Yuan decided to devote
                himself to studying how to increase the yields of rice, a staple food for over 60 percent of Chinese
                people. He then began a special lifelong connection with rice.</p>
            <p class="timeline-text">Yuan succeeded in cultivating the world's first high-yielding hybrid rice strain in
                1973, which could reach a yield of over 500 kg per mu (about 0.067 hectares), rising from the previous
                yield of only 300 kg per mu.</p>
            <p class="timeline-text">In 1996, the Chinese agriculture ministry formally established a super rice
                breeding program. Four years later, the first phase of the target of reaching 10.5 tonnes per hectare
                was achieved. The record was shattered three more times with jumps to 12 tonnes in 2004, 13.5 tonnes in
                2011 and 15 tonnes in 2014.</p>
            <p class="timeline-text">In 2020, hybrid rice developed by Yuan's team achieved 1,500 kilograms per mu
                (about 22.5 tonnes per hectare) in two growing seasons, a new world record.</p>
            <p class="timeline-text">In October 2020, a rice breed developed by Yuan's team achieved a yield of 802.9 kg
                per mu (12.04 tonnes per hectare) on average in three plots of saline soil in Rudong County, east
                China's Jiangsu Province, a record output for rice grown on saline soil in China. </p>
            <p class="timeline-text">In June 2020, his team started to grow seawater rice on a farm at an altitude of
                2,800 meters in northwest China's Qinghai Province, the first such trial on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

            <p class="timeline-text">On 22 May 2021, Longping Yuan dies at age of 90.</p>
